package routes

func Routes() {
	// code for route should be placed here
	// also controller name can be passed here

	// so exact way of its working is that
	// 1. Routes called -> Controllers consts
	// 2. Controller called -> Service consts
	// 3. Service does the required things and also calls -> DB operations like fetch/update/etc and gives the results
}
